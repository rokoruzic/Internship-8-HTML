            <h1><u>Everybody Jump</u></h1>
            <p>  What would happen if everyone on earth stood as close to each other as they could and <br> jumped, 
             everyone landing on the ground at the same instant? <br>
             —Thomas Bennett (and many others)</p>
             <p>This is one of the most popular questions submitted to this blog. It’s been examined before
             , including by a <br> <a href="www.google.hr">ScienceBlogs</a> post and a <a href="www.google.hr">Straight Dope</a>  article. They cover the kinematics pretty well.
              However, they don’t tell the <br> whole story.</p>
              <p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
              <p>At the start of the scenario, the entire Earth’s population has been magically transported together into one place.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_standing.png" alt="everybody_jump_standing">
              <p>This crowd takes up an area the size of Rhode Island. But there’s no reason to use the vague phrase “an area the size of <br> Rhode Island”. 
                This is our scenario; we can be specific. They’re actually in Rhode Island.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_map1.png" alt="everybody_jump_map1">
              <p>At the stroke of noon, everyone jumps.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_jumping.png" alt="everybody_jump_jumping">
              <p>As discussed elsewhere, it doesn’t really affect the planet. Earth outweighs us by a factor of over ten trillion. On <br> average,
                   we humans can vertically jump maybe half a meter on a good day. Even if the Earth were rigid and responded <br> instantly, 
                   it would be pushed down by less than an atom’s width.</p>
              <p>Next, everyone falls back to the ground.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_standing.png" alt="everybody_jump_standing">
              <p>Technically, this delivers a lot of energy into the Earth, but it’s spread out over a large enough area that it doesn’t 
                  do <br> much more than leave footprints in a lot of gardens. A slight pulse of pressure spreads through the North American <br>
                  continental crust and dissipates with little effect. The sound of all those feet hitting the ground creates a loud, drawn- <br> out roar which lasts many seconds.</p>
              <p>Eventually, the air grows quiet.</p>
              <p>Seconds pass. Everyone looks around.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_talking1.png" alt="everybody_jump_talking1">
              <p>There are a lot of uncomfortable glances. Someone coughs.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_talking2.png" alt="everybody_jump_talking2">
              <p>A cell phone comes out of a pocket. Within seconds, the rest of the world’s five billion phones follow. All of them—even <br> those
                   compatible with the region’s towers—are displaying some version of “NO SIGNAL”. The cell networks have all <br> collapsed under the unprecedented load.</p>
              <p>Outside Rhode Island, abandoned machinery begins grinding to a halt.</p>
              <p>The T. F. Green airport in Warwick, Rhode Island handles a few thousand passengers a day. Assuming 
                  they got things <br> organized (including sending out scouting missions to retrieve fuel), they could run at 500% capacity for years without <br> making a dent in the crowd.</p>
              <img src="everybody_jump_map2.png" alt="everybody_jump_map2">
              <p>The addition of all the nearby airports doesn’t change the equation much. Nor does the region’s light rail system. <br> Crowds climb on board container ships in the deepwater port of Providence,
                   but stocking sufficient food and water for <br> a long sea voyage proves a challenge.</p>
              <p>Rhode Island’s half-million cars are commandeered. Moments later, I-95, I-195, and I-295 become the sites of the <br> largest traffic jam in the history of the planet. Most of the
                   cars are engulfed by the crowds, but a lucky few get out and <br> begin wandering the abandoned road network.</p>
              <p>Some make it past New York or Boston before running out of fuel. Since the electricity is probably not on at this point <br>, rather than find a working gas pump,
                   it’s easier to just abandon the car and steal the new one. Who can stop you? All <br> the cops are in Rhode Island.</p>
              <p>The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are <br> unlikely to have a language in common, 
                  and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a patchwork chaos of <br> coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common.
                   Everybody is hungry and thirsty. Grocery stores are <br> emptied. Fresh water is hard to come by and there’s no efficient system for distributing it.</p>
              <p>Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.</p>
              <p>The survivors spread out across the face of the world and struggle to build a new civilization atop the pristine ruins of <br> the old. Our species staggers on, but our population has
                   been greatly reduced. Earth’s orbit is completely unaffected— <br> it spins along exactly as it did before our species-wide jump.</p>
              <p>But at least now we know.</p>
